<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, <br/> This is me, <strong>Tudor</strong>, fiddling with computers since I was 14. <br/> My strengths are exploring, learning, obsessing with problem-solving and generalizing solutions. <br/> Also, optimizing when things work, but there's room for improvement . <br/> I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tudorilisoi/trawl4"> Web crawler </a>, nobody asked me to. I just needed to explore the problem domain. <br/> I rewrote my WIFI router firmware with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"> OSS </a> alternative because I knew I can get more out of that hardware. <br/> I taught/mentored for compensation ( <u><a href="http://thinkful.com/"> thinkful.com </a></u><u><strong>~4 years</strong></u> ), and also for free because I love to see people grow and evolve. <br/> I jumped from the PHP boat to <strong>Javascript</strong> because I saw what a functional/object-oriented language can do to your reasoning („a good programming language changes the way you think”) ( <strong>2016</strong> ) . <br/> I learned <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><strong>Typescript</strong></a> because I saw the value of strictly typed Javascript and how it enhances the developer experience (DX) and the code quality ( <strong>2021</strong> ) <br/> I did some <strong>Java</strong> just because a friend of mine owned a restaurant and, at some point in time, he chose an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"> OSS </a> Java POS software ( <strong>long time ago</strong> ) . <br/> I learned <a href="https://flutter.dev/"><strong>Flutter</strong></a> because I saw some limitations in the <strong>React-Native</strong> JS-to-native bridge. <br/> I invented a rudiment of <strong><a href="https://graphql.org/"> GraphQL </a></strong> (subtree fetching from a relational database) because I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><strong>REST</strong></a>, albeit formalized and all, has some severe limitations ( <strong>2013</strong> ) . <br/> I share all I know and I value good input ( <strong>since forever</strong> ) .</p>
<p>Nowadays I do <a href="https://reactjs.org/"><strong>React</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><strong>Typescript</strong></a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><strong>node.js</strong></a>, and everything in between.</p>
<p>This is who I am, please get in touch if you need to hire an open-minded, ever-learning, constructive-criticism-bound, savvy tech guy who is first and foremost a <strong>human-loving</strong> and <strong>communication-oriented</strong> person.</p>
